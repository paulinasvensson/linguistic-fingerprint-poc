st.markdown("""
**About the Application – Linguistic Fingerprint Identifier**  
This tool enables the analysis of written language to identify stylistic patterns that may be characteristic of a particular type of author. Using natural language processing and machine learning, the system estimates the likelihood that a given text corresponds to one of the predefined author profiles.  

The application may be of interest in legal, forensic, or regulatory contexts where authorship attribution, stylistic analysis, or text comparison is of relevance. Please note that this is a demonstrational prototype; analytical results should be interpreted with caution and not be considered conclusive evidence.  

**Available Author Profiles:**  
- **Author A:** Technical expert in AI and data science  
- **Author B:** Legal professional with formal writing style  
- **Author C:** Informal, conversational style typical of everyday communication
