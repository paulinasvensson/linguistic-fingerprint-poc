Person 1: Based on our previous interactions, I compiled the engagement   
metrics into a dashboard. The results indicate a 23% increase in 
efficiency post-implementation.

Person 2: oh wow thatâ€™s awesome! didnâ€™t expect that lol ðŸ˜… do you think we
can hit 30 if we fix the notification thing?

Person 1: That is plausible. If we refine the alert logic and reduce 
redundancy in the API calls, we could likely reach that benchmark.

Person 2: nicee sounds good! btw iâ€™ll be offline tomorrow, dentist ðŸ˜­
